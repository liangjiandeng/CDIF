# Method

- Motivation: Fig. 1. (a) Plot of the intensity for both the PAN image and the HRMS data
randomly choosing a row of the image; (b) Plot of the gradient intensity for
both the PAN image and the HRMS data considering blue (B), green (G), red
(R), and near-infrared (NIR) bands for the same row as in (a). It is worth to
be remarked that the behavior of PAN and HRMS images is more similar in
the gradient domain than in the intensity domain.
